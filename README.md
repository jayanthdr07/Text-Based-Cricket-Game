## 🧠 Logic Used
- **Random Number Generation**
  - `Random` class is used to simulate computer batting and bowling plays
- **Conditional Statements**
  - `if-else` conditions determine runs, wickets, and match results
- **Loops**
  - `for` and `while` loops manage overs and balls (6 balls per innings)
- **User Input Handling**
  - `Scanner` class is used to take player input from the console
- **Methods**
  - Separate methods for batting and bowling to improve readability and modularity
- **Constants**
  - Fixed number of balls per innings for consistent gameplay
- **Score Comparison**
  - Final scores are compared to declare the match result (Win/Loss)

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

- Add wickets count instead of single-out logic

- Introduce overs and real cricket rules

- Implement difficulty levels

- Add score history and leaderboard

- Create a GUI using Java Swing or JavaFX
